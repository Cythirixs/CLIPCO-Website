                <h2>Frequently asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> What is CLIPCO? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> The Cupertino Union School District (CUSD) does not fund the Mandarin portion of the
                    Cupertino Language Immersion Program (CLIP). When CLIP was initially established, the parents of the
                    first students created CLIPCO, a non-profit 501(c)(3) support organization, as an easy way for parents
                    to donate money to the program. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> How is CLIP different from CLIPCO? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CLIP is the name of our program: Cupertino Language Immersion Program. CLIPCO is the
                    non-profit support organization. CLIPCO stands for Cupertino Language Immersion Program Community
                    Organization. CLIPCO consists of parent volunteers who are tasked with raising money to support
                    CLIP.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> What does my donation pay for? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Your donation pays for Mandarin texts, development of curriculum, duplication of
                    curriculum, instructional aides, Mandarin books for the Library, and anything that pertains to the
                    Mandarin portion of our program. Please go to the CAC &amp; Budget page for more detailed budget
                    information.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> What does CLIPCO do? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CLIPCO is responsible for raising money each year. Our biggest fundraiser is our
                    Direct Give Campaign. If parents contribute each year, our students are ensured the best quality
                    Mandarinlearning possible. CLIPCO also helps to bring our CLIP community together by holding various
                    CLIP events such as the Welcome Picnic and the Spring Banquet. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> What are some of the CLIPCO events?</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CLIPCO events include Town Hall Meetings, Welcome Picnic, Spring Banquet and the
                    Mandarin Language Contest. More informaiton can be found on our Programs &amp; Committees page.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> How is CLIPCO different from the PTA? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> The PTA is responsible for raising money for ALL children of Meyerholz to help fund
                    music, art, PE and technology for our school. PTA will also ask you for a separate donation to help fund
                    the various programs at Meyerholz. CLIPCO funds only the Mandarin and supplemental portion of the CLIP
                    curriculum not covered by the district and PTA. Your child benefits from both donations. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> What is the CAC? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CAC is the Curriculum Advisory Committee. This committee was set up by the district
                    to help make curriculum decisions with parent and teacher involvement. CAC and CLIPCO work
                    collaboratively. The CAC board is composed of teachers, parents, and principals. They present funding
                    needs to CLIPCO, which in turn raises the money to cover those needs. Find more information on the CAC
                    &amp; Budget page.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> Why doesn't the CUSD pay for the Mandarin portion of our program? </strong>
                </p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CUSD funds the English portion of the CLIP curriculum. Our students receive the same
                    amount of money as other students in the Cupertino Union School District. However, additional funds are
                    required each year to cover the Mandarin portion of the curriculum and its continued development. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> Do other schools in the Cupertino Union School District ask for
                    donations? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Yes, all the other alternative programs and regular programs ask for donations. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> How do I know where my money is being spent? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CLIPCO works with the district to let parents know where the money is being spent.
                    Everytime there is a change in the state-mandated curriculum, the Mandarin portion must be updated,
                    translated, and developed. Please check the CAC &amp; Budget page for more details.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> What are the Goals of CLIPCO? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CLIPCO's primary goal is to raise money and to support CLIP by reaching 100%
                    participation level among families in CLIP. Each year we need to raise a significant amount of money to
                    pay for the necessary parts of our program. CLIPCO also strives to to increase communication, create a
                    strong parent community, help us all embrace the Mandarin culture, and have fun. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> Why is 100% participation so important? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Full participation in the direct give campaign demonstrates the commitment of our
                    parent community. It also ensures a quality Mandarin education and fulfills your family's education
                    goals. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> How much should I give? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Each year the CLIPCO Board of Directors assess the need of the program and determine
                    the suggested donation amount. Please check the Direct Give donation page for the current year's
                    suggested donation amount. Every donation, regardless of size, is important to CLIP and our kids. </p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> How can I give my donation? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> CLIPCO accepts cash, checks made payable to CLIPCO, and credit cards. Please make a
                    credit card payment or monthly installment plans by visiting on Donation page.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> Does CLIPCO really need my donation? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Yes, if your child is in the program, your child uses new texts, receives Mandarin
                    instruction, and benefits from all aspects of our program. Your donation ensures the ongoing success of
                    our program for YOUR child.</p>
                <p><strong class="faq-question"> I can't seem to make a monetary donation this year. How can I help
                    otherwise? </strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer"> Please consdier making a smaller donation that fits your budget and/or utilizing our

                        equipment at a significantly reduced cost.
