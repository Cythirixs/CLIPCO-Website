            <h4>2018 Registration now closed. Click <a href="/ASEP_class_information.html"> here</a> for information on classes.</h4>
            <h4>ASEP classes are off to a great start for the 2017-18 school year.  We have over 110 students registered for a variety of classes, which include: Chinese Calligraphy, Brushpainting, Lion Dance, Percussion, Chinese Dance, Wushu, Erhu, Chinese Flute, and Baking. The children are very excited to immerse themselves in the various aspects of Chinese culture and look forward to showcasing what they've learned.  We look forward to seeing the families and parents at our Winter Showcase (December 7, 2016) and our Spring Showcase (May 11, 2018).</h4>
                <h4>We're so proud of all the kids and extremely thankful to the instructors, parent coordinators, and volunteers who help to make this program a success.  Stephanie Wang, our amazing Chinese liaison, has decided to step down so we are looking for someone to fill her position. If anyone is interested in learning more about this position, please contact clipasep@gmail.com.</h4>
            <h2>ASEP Mission:</h2>
            <h4>To provide a quality after school enrichment program for Meyerholz Elementary school and the Cupertino Language Immersion Program focusing on Chinese Culture and Language.</h4>
            <br>
            <h2>ASEP History:</h2>
            <h4>CLIP’s After School Enrichment Program (ASEP) was started by CLIP parent volunteers during the 2006-2007 academic year and moved under the CLIPCO umbrella in 2008. Classes are open to all CLIP and Meyerholz Elementary students.<br>
                ASEP initially started with three major components, after school classes, Chinese language contests and Chinese New Year Parade Team. Due to the size and success of the language contest and parade team, both programs were split off and managed as their own entity.<br>
                The classes offered have varied over the years. Each year ASEP has provided an average of eight classes each year. They range from performing arts to visual arts and from traditional techniques to modern.</h4>
            <br>
            <h2>About ASEP:</h2>
            <h4>ASEP is a fully self-funded non-profit program. Professional instructors, chosen for their specialties,
                come on site at Meyerholz Elementary to teach the classes. Having the classes after school and on school
                premises, allows ASEP to offer high level education that is convenient for parents and a fraction of the
                cost of similar classes. The large number of parent volunteers are key in keeping the overhead low and
                the quality high.</h4>
            <br>
            <h2>ASEP PERFORMANCES:</h2>
            <h4>Each year, ASEP puts on two major showcase performances. The winter showcase gives all the performing
                classes a chance to highlight what they have worked on to family and friends. At the CLIPCO spring
                banquet, they perform for a wider audience and help celebrate the year’s graduating classes. The visual
                arts classes also get a chance to shine at these events through slide shows and displays at the events.
                <br>
