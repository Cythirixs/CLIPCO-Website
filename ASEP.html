          <h2>ASEP Mission:</h2>
          <h4>To provide a quality after school enrichment program for Meyerholz Elementary school and the Cupertino Language Immersion Program focusing on Chinese Culture and Language.</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>ASEP History:</h2>
          <h4>CLIP’s After School Enrichment Program (ASEP) was started by CLIP parent volunteers during the 2006-2007 academic year and moved under the CLIPCO umbrella in 2008. Classes are open to all CLIP and Meyerholz Elementary students. ASEP initially started with three major components, after school classes, Chinese language contests and Chinese New Year Parade Team. Due to the size and success of the language contest and parade team, both programs were split off and managed as their own entity. The classes offered have varied over the years. Each year ASEP has provided an average of eight classes each year. They range from performing arts to visual arts and from traditional techniques to modern.</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>About ASEP:</h2>
          <h4>ASEP is a fully self-funded non-profit program. Professional instructors, chosen for their specialties, come on site at Meyerholz Elementary to teach the classes. Having the classes after school and on school premises, allows ASEP to offer high level education that is convenient for parents and a fraction of the cost of similar classes. The large number of parent volunteers are key in keeping the overhead low and the quality high.

          <br>
          <h2>ASEP Proformances:</h2>
          <h4>Each year, ASEP puts on two major showcase performances. The winter showcase gives all the performing classes a chance to highlight what they have worked on to family and friends. At the CLIPCO spring banquet, they perform for a wider audience and help celebrate the year’s graduating classes. The visual arts classes also get a chance to shine at these events through slide shows and displays at the events.
          <br><br>
          In addition to the two annual showcases, ASEP performers have been invited to perform for many events for the Cupertino and educational community. Some of the events include CEEF and CABE banquets, CLIPCO’s Chinese New Year celebration, RAFT celebration, and Cupertino’s Fall Festival. ASEP students have also won awards from the Santa Clara young artists competition and Chinese Language competitions. ASEP also presented by our students at the Cupertino school board meeting as the Meyerholz highlight this year.

          <h2>Additional Information:</h2>
          <h4>The ASEP classes are off to a great start for the 2011-2012 school year. We had 120 students register for eight different classes which include: Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Brush Painting, Dance (Chinese/Modern), Go game, Lion Dance, Chinese Flute, Chinese Percussion and Wushu. We introduced online registration for the first time before the end of the last school. This gave us time to plan for budgeting, site usage and instructors hiring. As a result, some of the classes were able to start on the second week of school. The fall session will go through December and the spring session will pick up again at the end of February. We are looking forward to seeing the families and parents come enjoy the ASEP winter showcase on December 7, 2011, 7:00pm in the Meyerholz GLC.</h4>
