                <p><strong class="faq-question">Is ASEP program available for the CLIP students who don’t continue with CLIP middle school program?</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">This program is only offered to all Meyerholz students and CLIP middle school students. Middle school students who do not continue with CLIP will not be able to enroll for any of the ASEP classes.

                <p><strong class="faq-question">My kid is in 5th grade wants to be on the Meyerholz sport team. Do you know if this conflicts with Lion Dance? Can he do both? Can we sign him up if we don’t get into the Meyerholz sports team?</strong></p>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Meyerholz upper grades sport team schedule conflicts with ASEP classes on Mondays and Fridays. Please also keep in mind that the sport team uses lottery system when there is more interests than the team members allowed. Futhermore, the start date of the sport team is after ASEP start date so you won’t be able to join any of the ASEP classes after the sport team lottery.</p>
