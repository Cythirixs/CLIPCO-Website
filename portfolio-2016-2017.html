                                B.C., people in ancient Greece began making pottery. Some 100,000+ pieces of vases, wine
                                vessels, and prize cups for athletic games winners, etc. have been recorded from the
                                classical era. The potteries were used for both ornamental and practical purposes. Large
                                amphoras would be used to hold olives, olive oil, honey, and wine. A Panathenaic Games
                                (a version of the Olympic Games) winner would be awarded an amphora filled with 10
                                gallons of the best olive oil. The winner of the chariot race received as a prize
                                one-hundred and forty "Panathenaic Amphorae" full of olive oil, a great honor indeed!
                                Students learned about the four main periods in ancient Greek pottery: 1) the
                                Minoan/Mycenaean period, 2) the geometric period, 3) the orientalizing period and 4) the
                                Archaic period in which the black and red figure painting were most popular. They then
                                created a an ancient Greek themed artwork on scratch paper simulating the black and red
                                figure pottery.</font></p>

                                cloth puppets, is believed to have first taken the stage in China in the early 1300s.
                                <span>&nbsp;</span>Performed during festivities mostly in front of temples where large
                                crowds would gather to watch, classical glove puppetry was considered the &ldquo;poor

                                themes, characters and costumes were taken directly from the big
                                stage.<span>&nbsp; </span>Intricate martial-arts acrobatics became a central feature,
                                requiring incredible puppetry skills. &nbsp;To welcome Chinese New Year, the CLIP middle
                                schoolers &nbsp;created these colorful Chinese glove puppets using ceramics and cloth.&nbsp;
                                Their characters, many of them imaginary, consist of awesome swordsmen, heroes,
                                villains, beauty, beasts, and many other magical <span id="lw_1335685982_1">mythological characters</span>.

                                students painted bamboo and learned the meanings behind this venerable plant.&nbsp; They
                                used the traditional technique which emphasizes the strength of the stroke and the
                                lightness and darkness of the ink to paint the body of the bamboo and the leaves, then
                                they went wild with the splash ink technique in creating the background and the mood for

                                the rebirth of the River Nile to the harsh conditions of the desert.&nbsp; All these
                                were later documented colorfully in the&nbsp; mythologies that were written down by the
                                Greeks.&nbsp; These mythologies that were originally passed down orally for thousands of
                                years taught the Egyptians how to live, and served as an important guide to the
                                deceased.&nbsp; The 6th graders used ancient Egyptian symbols, geography, hieroglyphs,
                                images of mythological figures and pharaohs to simulate an Egyptian tomb carving.</font>

                                clay tablets provided detailed documentation of life from some 5,000 years ago.&nbsp;
                                The use of the clay tablet is not that much different from the way we use our iPads or
                                iPods or iPhones nowadays, they were used as calendars, to play games, to record music
                                as well as to communicate.&nbsp; The students did note that one major difference is that
                                there were no cell or wifi network 5,000 years ago.&nbsp; On their clay tablets, the 6th
                                graders created important Mesopotamian symbols such as the sun, the tree of life, the
                                eagle and the lion in bas relief, then they made cuneiform imprint using a bamboo

                                We examined totems from China as well as the Pacific Northwest, and we also examined the
                                use of specific U-shapes, double-U shapes, ovoids, form lines as well as the need to
                                fill an entire space in the Northwest coast art and compared it to the images on ancient
                                Chinese bronzes.&nbsp; Ms. Tseng also brought in a couple of&nbsp; native American art
                                pieces from a Bay Area collector to show the students.&nbsp; This kind of cross-cultural
                                comparison raised the question of whether similar iconography in art could have arisen
                                spontaneously from two different regions, or whether people from these different regions
                                had similar experiences in the past.&nbsp; These questions have been posed by
                                archeologists and art historians, and now our 8th grade students had a chance to
                                ruminate on it while they created beautiful paintings in this style (the first two are

                                art created by sailors who sometimes had to spend months or years on sailboats.&nbsp;
                                Materials that were readily available to them were bones from sea animals and sail

                                in 1973.&nbsp; The 8th graders simulated scrimshaw carving with images of sailboats used
                                by the early explorers as well as the early American settlers.&nbsp; They studied 10

                                -Working on the premise that art should be anionic - without images of human or animals
                                - Islamic artists and architects have developed some of the most amazing and creative
                                patterns using geometric shapes, vegetal shapes, and calligraphy. These patterns help
                                them express the ideal of diversity within unity. Since math and geometric shapes are
                                also universal languages which possess the ability to express the mysteries of the
                                universe, it is also viewed as a language of the divine as well as a language to pay
                                respect to the divine. In part 1 of this lesson, students learned how circles can be
                                transformed into a multitude of regular polygons and star shapes. In part two, students
                                transformed a single 2" x 2" block of an abstract pattern that they created into 4
                                distinct patterns by arranging them in radial symmetry. At the end of the lesson, each
                                of the student created a print of their pattern to put on a 'mihrab' - the most
                                important feature in any Islamic building, a semicircular niche in a wall that indicates
                                the qibla, i.e. the direction of Mecca.</font></p>

                                this one of a kind art using the simple tools available on a boat - bones of teeth from
                                sea animals, a sail needle, and some coal ash from their cooking or cigarette ash mixed
                                with a bit of whale oil to mix a black paste. They would take a piece of whale bone or
                                tooth, sanding it smooth with shark skin, then carve on it with a sail needle. In the
                                end, they would rub the black paste on to make their pictures came alive. The themes
                                were mostly nautical, including boats, maps, mermaids, sea animals and sometimes, people
                                whom they missed. In this CLIP Art lesson, the 8th graders saw history through the
                                romance and adventures of some of the most famous sail boats from the 16th-18th
                                centuries. They then simulated the carving of scrimshaw on a candle, rubbing some black
                                acrylic into the carved lines in the end to make their pictures came to life!</font></p>
