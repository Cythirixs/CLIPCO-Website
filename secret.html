        		<h4>A story:</h4>
        		<p>There was once a homeless man who lived by a lake. He like to swim in the lake. There were also some rocks off to the side of the lake that he could jump off of into the water. During the summer months he would spend his time practicing diving tricks into the water. During the winter, however, the lake would freeze over. One day, he sees a father and his young daughter walking out on the ice. As they are walking the ice breaks and the daughter falls in. The father behind to freak out, he doesn't know what to do. As the homeless man is quite proficient in swimming, he decides to go out and save the little girl from the water. once the girl and her father are safely on dry ground, the father begins to thank the homeless man.</p>
        		<p>He says, &quot;Thank you so much for saving my daughter. I am a very rich man, anything you want, just ask me, and I will give it to you as a repayment for saving my daughter. &quot;</p>
        		<p>The homeless man thinks for a second. Then he says to the man, &quot;I have been living by this lake for a long time. I would more than anything like to go out and see the world. Can I have a ticket for one cruise around the world?&quot;</p>
        		<p>The man says &quot; Of course.&quot; and gives the man a ticket for an around the world cruise.</p>
        		<p>The homeless man is overjoyed. He packs up his things, and the very next day he heads over to the dock where the cruise ship is waiting. When the captain sees him trying to board the ship he stops him.</p>
        		<p>Now hold up.&quot; The captain says. &quot;I don't want any greasy hobos getting on my boat. You might scare off the other passengers.&quot;</p>
        		<p>But I have a ticket.&quot; Says the homeless man, and shows his ticket to the captain.</p>
        		<p>&quot;Well, alright.&quot;&nbsp;Says the captain.&nbsp;&quot;I'll let you on the boat, but you can only come out at night, so you don't cause any trouble with the other passengers.&quot;</p>
        		<p>The homeless man is still excited to just be on the boat, so he agrees to the captain's terms. The captain tells him to wait around the corner until all of the other passengers have gotten on the boat. That night, the captain comes and gets the homeless man and escorts him on to the boat. Once on the boat, the homeless man leaves his stuff at his room and walks around the boat for a bit to see what is there. He sees all kinds of wonderful things, like a 24 hr buffet, bowling alleys, and water slides. But the thing that catches his eye the most is the diving board by the swimming pool. It reminded him of his old camp by the lake. He climbed up onto the diving board and decided to try some of his old diving tricks. At this point, the captain decided to come out and check on the homeless man to make sure he wasn't causing any trouble. He saw the homeless man's diving tricks and was quite impressed. He decided that he could make a show out of the homeless man's diving tricks for the other passengers to watch. The homeless man agrees and the show proceeds.</p>
        		<p>On the first day of the show, the crowd loves it. They are all cheering for the man. The captain is satisfied with the homeless man's performance, but feels he could do even crazier tricks if he had a taller diving board. The captain has a higher board built on the boat and the show continues. The homeless man does some even crazier tricks now. Triple flips and spins and all kind of crazy things. But still the captain thinks the diving board could be higher. So he build an <em>even</em> higher diving board. This one is so high that the homeless man cannot even see top of the board. He begins his routine, and begins to ascend the diving board. The crowd has all of their eyes on him. He keeps climbing. He is up in the clouds now. Still climbing. When he gets to the top the cruise ship is just a little far away dot. He closes his eyes, gets ready, and jumps. One flip, two flips, three, four, five. They keep coming, spins and flips and all kinds of crazy things. The crowd is going wild. When he hits the water he is going so fast that he shoots right through to the bottom of the pool, through the bottom, and into to ocean below the cruise ship. He is dazed and flounders around trying to get back to the surface. Just as he thinks he is going to run out of air, the captains arm reaches in and pulls him out. He brings him on to the deck, where the crowd promptly goes wild. They are all congratulating the homeless man.</p>
        		<p>Once the applause subsides, the captain asks the homeless man &quot;That ship is made of the hardest metal that a boat has ever been made of. How did you make it all the way through the boat and survive?&quot;</p>
        		<p>The homeless man thought for a second, then replied &quot;Well, I'm a homeless man, life is tough, I've been through many <strong>hardships</strong> in my life before.&quot;</p>
