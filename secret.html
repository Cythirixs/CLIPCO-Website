            <h4>A story:</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was once a homeless man who lived by a lake. He like to swim ib the lake. There were also some rocks off to the side of the lake that he could jump off of into the water. During the summer months he would spend his time practicing diving tricks into the water. Durning the winter, however, the lake would freeze over. One day, he sees a father and his young daughter walking out on the ice. As they are walking the ice breaks and the daughter falls in. The father begind to freak out, he doesn't know what to do. As the homeless man is quite proficient in swimming, he decides to go out and save the little girl from the water. once the girl and her father are safely on dry ground, the father begins to thank the homeless man.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says, &quot;Thank you so much for saving my daughter. I am a very rich man, anything you want, just ask me, and I will give it to you as a repayment for saving my daughter. &quot;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homeless man thinks for a second. Then he says to the man, &quot;I have been living by this lake for a long time. I would more than anything like to go out and see the world. Can I have a ticket for one cruise around the world?&quot;</p>
            <p>The man says &quot; Of course.&quot; and gives the man a ticket for an around the world cruise.</p>
            <p>The homeless man is overjoyed. He packs up his things, and the very next day he heads over to the dock where the cruise ship is waiting. When the captain sees him trying to board the ship he stops him.</p>
            <p>&quot;Now hold up.&quot; The captain says. &quot;I don't want any greasy hobos getting on my boat. You might scare off the other passengers.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;But I have a ticket.&quot; Says the homeless man, and shows his ticket to the captain.</p>
            <p>&quot;Well, alright.&quot;Says the captain.&quot;I'll let you on the boat, but you can only come out at night, so you don't cause any trouble with the other passengers.&quot;</p>
            <p></p>
