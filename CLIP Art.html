          <h2>About CLIP Art</h2>
          <h4>CLIP Art is a language/cultural enrichment art class funded by parents’ direct donations to CLIPCO.  CLIP students get CLIP Art (taught in Mandarin), as well as regular art (taught in English, and funded by parents’ donations to PTA).  CLIP Art is taught once a month, and each class is 1 ½ hour long.  The class structure is comprised of presentation, discussion, application and debriefing.</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>CLIP Art Curriculum</h2>
          <h4>Each month our CLIP Art teachers, Ms. Chwen Lim, Ms. Phoebe Kao and Ms. Karen Tseng, show the students a presentation on a different artist or art form.  The teachers make sure to tie in elements from the students’ curriculum, such as language arts, geography, science, history and social studies.  During the presentation, a lively dialogue in Mandarin almost always ensues!</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>An Example of a CLIP Art Lesson</h2>
          <h4>In April 2009 we compared a contemporary Chinese artist working in California to a contemporary abstract artist from New York as well as a traditional Chinese artist from 500 hundred years ago.  The students then created splash ink paintings using some of the contemporary Chinese artist’s methods as well as their own.  All the students, from kindergarten through eighth grade, were very enthusiastic about this project.<br><br>
          At the end of each lesson, we have a verbal debriefing of the students’ experience, or, if time allows, the students write about it in Mandarin.  Throughout the lesson, students are encouraged to speak their mind, develop critical thinking, and express their creativity in their art.
          </h4>

          <h2>Notable CLIP Art Creations</h2>
          <h4>In the past, many CLIP Art pieces were exhibited in the Cupertino Union School District office and in the Martin Luther King Jr. Library in San Jose.  Several students’ works were also selected for the Santa Clara County Office of Education’s permanent art collection.
