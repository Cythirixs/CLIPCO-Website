                <h2>Chinese Language Competition</h2>
                <h4>The CLC Mission is to provide opportunity for our students to gain experience outside of their
                    classroom
                    environment in public speaking, writing, reading and listening in Chinese. This event also serves as
                    stepping stones to prepare our students to go to the ANCCS Academy Contest and the CLTAC Speech
                    Contest
                    in April annually. Most of our internal contest rules are derived from these two major Northern
                    California contests.</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Chinese Language Contest got started five years ago by a group of parents. It was a grassroots effort
                    that took 6-9 months of research and planning. The contest categories vary from year to year
                    depending
                    on resources and manpower.</p>
