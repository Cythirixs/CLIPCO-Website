            <h2>Disclaimer </h2>
            <h4> Enrollment is decided by the Cupertino Union School District not CLIPCO. <br><br></h4>


            <h2>Transfer Enrollment Procedures</h2>
            <h4> Step One: <br>
                You have to live within the district boundaries at the time you register for school in order to apply to
                the program. In order to remain in the program CUSD residency is required. CLIP is one of the four
                alternative programs serving the Cupertino Union School District. Read through the information on this
                web site, research immersion education, understand the school's philosophy and make sure it's right for
                your child and your family.
                <br><br>
                Step Two: <br>
                Beginning in December of each year, parents interested in the CLIP program must register online at the
                Meyerholz Elementary School website to schedule a guided tour and presentation. In February, during the
                open enrollment period, only parents who have attended a guided tour and presentation can return to
                Meyerholz to register for CLIP and apply for the lottery.
                <br><br>
                Parents of incoming kindergarten children must also register at their neighborhood elementary school and
                receive a registration receipt.
